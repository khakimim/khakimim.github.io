In this paper, we looked at different parts of restaurants and how they affected how customers rated them overall.\n It used restaurant data from Zomato to help users find their favorite restaurants in new cities. The analyses have been done on eight features of two groups: \"quality and price\" and \"delivery.\" The restaurants use the random forest algorithm to score based on new and old data.\n The suggested method accurately ranked restaurants that have just opened with few users' comments. The model made here is 71% accurate when it comes to ranking.\n Additionally, this paper uses machine learning science to help restaurants improve their customer service by using this algorithm and paying more attention to the effective parameters here.
